That’s all you’ll need for this groundbreaking program. In barely an hour of workout time a week, you’ll destroy expectations and build a body to be reckoned with!<br><br>If you don’t associate kettlebell exercises with building muscle, well, that’s understandable. The way most people are using them in the gym is as a lightweight way to break a serious sweat, and nothing else. But make no mistake: Kettlebells can be a huge ally in the quest for mass. And, if you’re someone who has been relying largely on barbells or dumbbells, they could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.<br><br>As I explained in my article “Grind to Grow: Try Your Squats and Presses with Kettlebells,” part of the reason the kettlebell triggers newfound strength and muscle growth is because of its offset shape. It forces the body to stabilize its joints in a different manner from barbells, dumbbells, and other traditional bodybuilding equipment. This forces your muscles to contract in a different fashion than normal, and increases the demand placed upon them.<br><br>Want an example? Look no further than the extra depth that every lifter instantly discovers when they front squat with a pair of kettlebells in the rack position, versus a barbell across the back. With this new and increased range of motion comes increased muscular growth in your legs, and strength in your entire torso, from the inside out, including the all-important core musculature.<br><br>Best of all, the kettlebell lends itself to a simple, but very challenging programing. This 12-week program requires only two kettlebells and time for three workouts a week. But after one time through it, you’ll find yourself more muscular in all the areas that matter: shoulders, upper back, upper chest, arms, legs, and posterior chain. When you go back to “traditional” weight training, don’t be surprised if you destroy your old performances — and have to buy bigger shirts.<br><br><a href="https://www.plurk.com/p/o2kqsm">https://www.plurk.com/p/o2kqsm</a><br><br><a href="https://www.diigo.com/annotated/original/42fda2d4cc97485c4c593de65254318a">https://www.diigo.com/annotated/original/42fda2d4cc97485c4c593de65254318a</a><br><br><a href="https://mix.com/!VvOKw09S:kettlebell-exercises-%E2%80%94-double-kettlebell-high-pull">https://mix.com/!VvOKw09S:kettlebell-exercises-%E2%80%94-double-kettlebell-high-pull</a><br><br><a href="https://slashdot.org/submission/12657308/ouble-kettlebell-complex-for-fat-loss-workouts-with-geoff-neupert--herky-jerky">https://slashdot.org/submission/12657308/ouble-kettlebell-complex-for-fat-loss-workouts-with-geoff-neupert--herky-jerky</a><H3>Get Programmed For Growth   </H3>According to research by Brad Schoenfeld, PhD, there are three basic ways to stimulate muscle growth: [1]<br><br>Mechanical Tension: Lifting heavier weights for lower reps, similar to the way powerlifters train; think multiple sets of 2–5 reps.<br><br>Muscular Damage: Lifting moderate weights for medium to higher reps, similar to the way bodybuilders train; think multiple sets of 8–20 reps.<br><br>Metabolic Stress: Doing either high reps or complexes where you don’t set the weight down, producing intense burning and the release of metabolites like lactate.<br><br>In this program, you’ll have a 4-week phase devoted to each pathway. But in all three phases, you’ll utilize just three kettlebell exercises: the double-kettlebell military press, front squat, and swing. That may not sound like enough variety to grow on, but all major movement patterns are covered by these exercises:<br><br>Military Press: Upper body pressing and pulling (due to the clean that accompanies the press)<br><br>Front Squat: Lower body pushing and upper body pulling (you’ll need to clean again!)<br><br>Swing (single or double kettlebell): Lower body pulling<br><br>You’ll perform these three days a week, on alternating days, using an A/B split. An A/B split is where you alternate workouts between Workout A and Workout B. So one week you’ll go A/B/A, and the next, B/A/B. It’s one of the most effective total-body approaches around.<br><br>Here’s what will comprise your two workouts:<br><br>Workout A:  <H3> Military Press</H3>Front SquatWorkout B:<H3> Swing</H3>You’ll perform each workout six times over a 4-week period.
