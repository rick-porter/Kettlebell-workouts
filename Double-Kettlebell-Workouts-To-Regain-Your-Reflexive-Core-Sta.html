I gave up all barbell and kettlebell work and just focused on bodyweight training, using exercises such as the OS dead bug in my program.<br><br>When I picked up a barbell again in 2012, I had lost 20 pounds of body weight, yet I came back stronger in certain posterior-chain-dominant exercises, like the double kettlebell clean, where I was able to perform 4 sets of 10 reps using a pair of 88-pound kettlebells with just two minutes of rest between sets. Checking my training log, I had never been able to do that before. I almost immediately snatched 220 pounds from the hang position as well, without having practiced it for two years.<br><br>In other words, I didn’t train the major lifts, and I got stronger — or at least maintained my strength in them — simply by restoring my reflexive core stability.<br><br>To restore your reflexive core stability, perform the OS dead bug, but use these specific cues to maximize your results<br><br>Focus on keeping your tailbone off the ground as you lower and raise your arms and legs.<br><br><a href="https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-push-press-workouts/">https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-push-press-workouts/</a><br><br><a href="https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-front-squat-workouts/">https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-front-squat-workouts/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.diigo.com/annotated/6d4cfb53975507ebb7888960c87841cb">https://www.diigo.com/annotated/6d4cfb53975507ebb7888960c87841cb</a><br><br><a href="https://mix.com/!IxNJ5MIz:double-kettlebell-exercieses-double-kettlebell-push-press">https://mix.com/!IxNJ5MIz:double-kettlebell-exercieses-double-kettlebell-push-press</a><br><br>Maintain a hip angle of less than 90 degrees on the leg that’s in the air.<br><br>Work up to 4 sets of 25 reps per side, with approximately 90 seconds of rest between sets, with straight legs.<br><br>If you can’t use straight legs and keep your tailbone off the ground, bend your knees, and over the course of time, work on getting them straighter.<br><br>Train the OS dead bug every day if you can.<br><br>How long will this take? As long as it takes you to hit those rep-and-rest markers. There is no hard-and-fast rule, but it will take you longer if you have a significant injury history like I do.<br><br>Meanwhile, reduce the loading in your other training by about 20 percent. Put everything on maintenance, in other words. Don’t stop — just reduce it. Keep doing what you love doing, but add the OS dead bug into the mix.<br><br>When you hit your 4 sets of 25, it’s time to turn up the volume again and start working your way back up to the heavier weights. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised, as I was, at the results.<H3>Contact Mr. Geoff Neupert:</H3>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
