Minimalism at its finest.<br><br>Composed some 7 years ago by Geoff Neupert, previous Master StrongFirst Qualified Trainer, Kettlebell STRONG! is now used through our StrongFirst online training platform. From SFG II candidates and strength fanatics to people who simply prefer double kettlebells training, we get numerous concerns. Who is Geoff? What does the shows include? Given what we've found out about mitochondrial functioning considering that its original release, are the skills and programs still legitimate? How does it fit within the Strong Endurance â„¢ structure? And is it right for me?<br><br>Brett Jones, StrongFirst's Director of Education, asked me to write an introduction of Kettlebell STRONG! with a "retrospective" of what, if anything, I would update, inside the programs. Let me first set the stage with some background.<H3>Why Practice What I Teach?</H3>My name is Geoff Neupert. I've been in the kettlebell "video game" since having made my first kettlebell instructor credentials in 2005. I was promoted to Master RKC in early 2010, just before the release of my book, Kettlebell Muscle. When Pavel formed StrongFirst, I followed and was a Master StrongFirst Certified Trainer up until 2014, when I stepped down for personal reasons-- to commit more time to my growing family, since I had returned to school full-time, and to grow another organisation. In April 2016, totally burned out from the fitness market, I retired. However having had sufficient time to bring back, I returned in mid-2019.<br><br>My athletic background is college wrestling and Olympic-style weight-lifting-- I was a state champ and Championship game qualifier in O-Lifting. And of my 30-year lifting history, I invested most of the first 20 recovering and working around some pretty major orthopedic injuries-- damaged bones, dislocations, compressed nerve roots, cartilage damage-- that sort of thing.<br><br>Within the greater kettlebell neighborhood, I was best known for my strength and weight loss programs. My method was very much influenced by my own athletic background and early professional experience training college athletes. In Olympic-style lifting, we need exceptionally high power outputs that necessitate high levels of maximum strength. Tiredness hinders attaining both of those things. On the other hand, fumbling is a power-endurance sport-- explosive movements like takedowns followed by lulls in the action, like riding time. A wrestler needs to train to conquer the impacts of hydrogen ion and lactic acid accumulation.<br><br>So my programming for performance has always been geared toward maximum force production and minimizing tiredness, no matter the goal. I constantly thought the more powerful, more effective athlete-- skills being equivalent-- wins.<H3>About Kettlebell STRONG!</H3>With that background and experience, I launched Kettlebell STRONG! in late 2012 as a DVD plus manual instructional series. The plan likewise included a multi-phase strength program, called the "Strong!" program, and a basic (however hard) conditioning program called the "One" program.<br><br>The premise of Kettlebell STRONG! is that you can get extremely strong with one set of kettlebells by consistently performing one substance workout well-- the Tidy and Press.<br><br>This procedure is detailed in the multi-phase, multi-mechanism "Strong!" program.<br><H3>Contact Us:</H3>Geoff Neupert<br>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
