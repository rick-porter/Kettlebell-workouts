Location the kettlebells on the ground in front of you.<br><br>2. Go back about half an action. You should be able to fold at the hips and still place your hands on the kettlebells.<br><br>3. Keep you direct and eyes on the horizon.<br><br>4. Aggressively trek the kettlebells in between your legs and beneath your body so you feel a stretch throughout your hips and down your hamstrings.<br><br>5. Drive your feet into the floor/ground and stand up hard. Drive with your whole foot, not simply your heels. Make sure your toes remain in contact with the ground at all times.<br><br>6. Contract your abs and squeeze your glutes hard. Power breathe as you snap your hips. The kettlebells should float up on their own by the power you generated with your hips. Goal to get them between waist and eye level. Mid-chest level, parallel to the ground is fantastic.<br><br>7. Trek the kettlebells back in between your legs for another rep.<br><br>8. Perform as many representatives as you select, however do not go to failure or into deep fatigue.<br><br>9. Keeping your chest up and an arched back, position the kettlebells safely on the ground after your final backswing. Make sure your back does not round when putting the kettlebells down. This can cause a lower back injury.<H3>Contact Us:</H3>Geoff Neupert<br>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
