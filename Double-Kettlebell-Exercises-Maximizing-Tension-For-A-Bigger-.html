Stabilizing parts<br><br>2. Moving parts<br><br><H3>Stabilizing parts</H3>I see everything listed below the sternum, with the exception of the lat( s) as "stabilizing parts" for the Press. In my mind, this entire location, from the breast bone to the feet, forms a pillar from which you press the weight from point A to point B - from your shoulder to lockout. If this area relocations, then there is a power leakage. Force is no longer directed exclusively at the kettlebell( s) but leaks out through the hole in the pillar.<br><br>There are four areas that need to stay tense during the climb of the kettlebell. They are -<br><br>The Feet. The feet should be pressed through the ground. I visualize them as roots of a tree.<br><br>The Legs. The kneecaps ought to be pulled up into the groin, making the quads agreement.<br><br>The Gluts. These need to be pinched tight, like holding a coin in between the cheeks. (Good images, I know ...)<br><br>The Abs. Should be braced as if prepared to soak up a punch.<br><br>Once again, these areas form the pillar from with to push.<br><br><a href="https://geoffworkouts.blogspot.com/2020/09/physicians-approval-before-starting.html">https://geoffworkouts.blogspot.com/2020/09/physicians-approval-before-starting.html</a><br><br><a href="https://quickstare.com/physician%ca%bcs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises/">https://quickstare.com/physician%ca%bcs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises/</a><br><br><a href="https://mix.com/!M2UyOWZm:physician%CA%BCs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-by-geoff-neupert">https://mix.com/!M2UyOWZm:physician%CA%BCs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-by-geoff-neupert</a><br><br><a href="https://medium.com/@mzichelejwashington/you-must-get-your-physician%CA%BCs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-88e3d3714ee6">https://medium.com/@mzichelejwashington/you-must-get-your-physician%CA%BCs-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-88e3d3714ee6</a><br><br><a href="https://www.scoop.it/topic/double-kettlebell-complex/p/4120587248/2020/09/02/physician-s-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-by-geoff-neupert">https://www.scoop.it/topic/double-kettlebell-complex/p/4120587248/2020/09/02/physician-s-approval-before-beginning-the-double-kettlebell-exercises-by-geoff-neupert</a><H3>The Moving parts</H3>These are the parts that really move the kettlebell. They are -<br><br>The Lat. This forms the "shelf" from which to push and supports (read: safeguards) the shoulder joints (the acromioclavicular joint, the glenohumeral joint, and to a lesser degree, the sternoclavicular joint).<br><br>The Deltoids. Responsible for elevating the arm.<br><br>The Triceps muscles. Responsible for lockout.<br><br>The majority of people concentrate on # 2 and # 3 above and forget everything about the lat in their efforts for a bigger Press. And after that they wind up with a rotator cuff injury - particularly, the supraspinatus, which gets pinched in the acromioclavicular area throughout the Press due to the fact that the lat is no longer engaged to stabilize the whole joint structure.<br><br>So How Do You Maximize The Tension?<br><br>Rather just, practice.<br><br>Spend most of your time concentrating on tensing the stabilizing parts while lifting lighter loads. Not necessarily light loads, however lighter loads. Certainly not heavy loads. (Remember, what you practice becomes long-term, and certainly under difficult situations. Lifting heavy, near optimum loads are difficult scenarios.)<br><br>Focus on driving your feet through the floor while pushing. Take note of the feedback your body gives you.<br><br>Concentrate on pulling your kneecaps into your groin while pressing. Once again, pay attention the to signals your body offers you.<br><br>Focus on pushing with your gluts pinched. And then your abs braced. And you thought it, focus on the feedback your body is giving you.<br><br>And then have fun with combinations - squeezing your gluts and tensing your abs; pressing your feet through the floor and bring up your kneecaps. Use different combinations up until you can do all 4 simultaneously.<br><br>Keep playing, practicing with the lighter weights concentrating on the "stabilizing parts." The lighter the weight, the more representatives you can do before fatiguing. The more reps you can do, the more you seal the pattern into your nerve system. And the sooner it will be that you can lift the larger weights without needing to think of contracting this muscle and that - you will have already established a pattern, and it will become essentially force of habit.<br><br>That way when you go to move the bigger weights, you will currently be maximizing stress and will have currently plugged the power leakages. What as soon as felt heavy will begin to feel light.<br><br>Then you can concentrate on dialing in the "moving parts" of the Press.<br><br>How long can you anticipate until you start seeing results?<br><br>Immediately.<br>Use these concepts to your Press practice before carrying on to anything fancy. You'll discover progress the very first time you carry out these strategies. And once again, the more you implement them into your training - your strength practice, the much easier and more familiar they'll end up being, yielding strong, discomfort and injury-free training for years to come.<H3>Contact Us:</H3>Geoff Neupert<br>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
