Rumor has it, that the Spetsnaz, the Soviet/Russian Special Forces systems, performed their PT specifically with high repetition C+J's using a set of 24kg kettlebells. Multiple sets of 20 to 30 associates were not unusual.<br><br>Later, Russian Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu clubs instituted high associate C+J's as part of their upper level brown and black belt promotion tests.<br><br>If you were going to spend your time doing "one" kettlebell workout, this very well could be it.<H3>How To Double Kettlebell Clean and Jerk</H3>1. Start with the kettlebells in front of you.<br><br>2. Aggressively hike the kettlebells behind you underneath your hips.<br><br>3. Tuck your elbows into your sides and roll the kettlebells around your wrists up the front of your body.<br><br>4. Keep the kettlebells pulled close to the body.<br><br><a href="https://quickstare.com/double-kettlebell-exercises-for-fat-loss-the-olympic-3-0/">https://quickstare.com/double-kettlebell-exercises-for-fat-loss-the-olympic-3-0/</a><br><br><a href="https://mix.com/!-5xB2T_K:double-kettlebell-exercises-sir-snatch-a-lot-double-kettlebell-complex-workout-by-geoff-neupert">https://mix.com/!-5xB2T_K:double-kettlebell-exercises-sir-snatch-a-lot-double-kettlebell-complex-workout-by-geoff-neupert</a><br><br><a href="https://www.scoop.it/topic/double-kettlebell-complex/p/4120528159/2020/08/29/double-kettlebell-exercises-and-how-to-perform-them">https://www.scoop.it/topic/double-kettlebell-complex/p/4120528159/2020/08/29/double-kettlebell-exercises-and-how-to-perform-them</a><br><br><a href="https://medium.com/@mzichelejwashington/double-kettlebell-exercises-double-kettlebell-complex-lucky-13-8231280826c7?source=friends_link&sk=392a9b60b944a33eadee265336d353bc">https://medium.com/@mzichelejwashington/double-kettlebell-exercises-double-kettlebell-complex-lucky-13-8231280826c7?source=friends_link&sk=392a9b60b944a33eadee265336d353bc</a><br><br><a href="http://getpocket.com/redirect?&url=https%3A%2F%2Fquickstare.com%2Fdouble-kettlebell-exercises-for-fat-loss-the-shoulder-smoker%2F&h=f8ec2857e692bb8813f27d449d6cb81c22ecb24969f6a66cb6dce3d29a60d532">http://getpocket.com/redirect?&url=https%3A%2F%2Fquickstare.com%2Fdouble-kettlebell-exercises-for-fat-loss-the-shoulder-smoker%2F&h=f8ec2857e692bb8813f27d449d6cb81c22ecb24969f6a66cb6dce3d29a60d532</a><br><br>5. Gently position them in the rack position. Keep the elbows glued to your ribs.<br><br>6. Similar to the Double Kettlebell Push Press, keeping the torso vertical<br><br>(perpendicular to the ground), dip your knees quickly and after that correct them.<br><br>7. As the kettlebells pass your forehead, drop below the kettlebells ending in a "mini-squat" with your arms locked overhead.<br><br>8. Straighten your knees and stand.<br><br>9. To lower the kettlebells, either pull them pull back to the rack or let them "freefall" soaking up or capturing them by dipping your knees.<br><br>10. To carry out another representative, repeat steps 6 through 9.<br><br>11. Lower the kettlebells to the ground the same way you would the Double Swing.<H3>Contact Us:</H3>Geoff Neupert<br>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
