It’s multiple motions woven together, incorporating all three movement planes more than once. Here it is broken down step-by-step, with details about how to move properly from each position to the next. Properly means safely. As we say in StrongFirst, safety is part of performance, not separate from it.<H3>1. Cradle And Grip The Kettlebell   </H3>Place the kettlebell next to the shoulder on the side you’re working.<br><br>Roll to your side and cradle the kettlebell with both hands. The working hand grips the kettlebell, and the opposite hand covers it.<br><br>Roll onto your back and place the kettlebell on your stomach.<H3>2. Press The Kettlebell Overhead</H3>Move the bell so the arm is perpendicular to the floor, either using one hand or both. Some people choose to add a single-arm press, but it’s extra credit and not the norm, especially once the weights get heavy. A two-handed pistol-grip press is just fine.<br><br>Lock out the elbow, and pull the loaded shoulder into its socket.<br><br>Bend the knee on the side of the body that’s holding the kettlebell.<br><br>Place the opposite arm on the floor approximately 45 degrees from the body.<H3>3. Roll Up Onto The Elbow, Then The Hand</H3>Take a deep breath and hold it.<br><br>Drive from the foot on the working side, roll up onto your elbow, and exhale. Once you’re stable at the elbow, roll up onto your hand. Don’t skip step three and go straight to the hand!<br><br><a href="https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-clean-workouts/">https://adfty.biz/article/double-kettlebell-clean-workouts/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.diigo.com/annotated/fff3a639b5f5eae4f5a89dce7b0bba81">https://www.diigo.com/annotated/fff3a639b5f5eae4f5a89dce7b0bba81</a><br><br><a href="https://mix.com/!_KNcIBSK:double-kettlebell-exercises-%E2%80%94-do-the-double-kettlebell-swing">https://mix.com/!_KNcIBSK:double-kettlebell-exercises-%E2%80%94-do-the-double-kettlebell-swing</a><br><br><a href="https://mzichelejwashington.medium.com/double-kettlebell-exercises-double-kettlebell-complex-workout-65f610154a2a">https://mzichelejwashington.medium.com/double-kettlebell-exercises-double-kettlebell-complex-workout-65f610154a2a</a><H3>4. Lift The Hips</H3>Squeeze your glutes and lift your hips off the ground high enough to be able to move your outstretched leg under your body. You’ll support yourself on one arm, the heel of the straight leg, and the surface of your flat foot, like a tripod.<br><br>Keep your arm extended totally vertically. When the weights get heavy, you’ll know why.<H3>5. Sweep The Leg And Find A Lunge</H3>Take your straight leg and pull or sweep it under your body, placing it next to and behind the hand on the floor.<br><br>You’ll end up in a position that makes your legs appear to be 90 degrees from each other. One knee will be pointing straight ahead, and the other should point directly at the hand on the floor.<br><br>Keep your neck rotated upward, looking up at the kettlebell in your hand.<H3>6. Stand Up From The Lunge</H3>Take your support hand off the floor and move your body upright, keeping the kettlebell overhead. At this point, shift your gaze so you are looking straight ahead.<br><br>“Windshield wiper” the leg that’s on the ground so that both legs are now parallel to each other, in a lunge position.<br><br>Drive from your back foot, through your hips, and into your front foot, standing up from the lunge. Keep looking forward!<H3>7. Descend From The Lunge</H3>and get down<br><br>While still looking forward, step back into the lunge so that your knee is on the floor.<br><br>“Windshield wiper” the back leg to perpendicular from the front leg.<br><br>Fold into your hips and place your hand just in front of the knee on the floor.<br><br>Stick your leg straight out in front of you and put your butt on the floor.<br><br>Roll down to your elbow, and then down onto your shoulders and back.<br><br>Lower the kettlebell with two hands to your stomach, then roll to your side and place the weight on the floor.<H3>Contact Mr. Geoff Neupert:</H3>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
