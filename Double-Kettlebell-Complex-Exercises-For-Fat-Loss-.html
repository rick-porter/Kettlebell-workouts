Place the kettlebells on the ground in front of you.<br><br>2. Go back about half an action. You should be able to fold at the hips and still position your hands on the kettlebells.<br><br>3. Keep you direct and eyes on the horizon.<br><br>4. Aggressively trek the kettlebells in between your legs and below your body so you feel a stretch across your hips and down your hamstrings.<br><br>5. Drive your feet into the floor/ground and stand hard. Drive with your whole foot, not simply your heels. Make certain your toes stay in contact with the ground at all times.<br><br>6. Agreement your abs and squeeze your glutes hard. Power breathe as you snap your hips. The kettlebells must drift up on their own by the power you created with your hips. Goal to get them in between waist and eye level. Mid-chest level, parallel to the ground is fantastic.<br><br>7. Hike the kettlebells back in between your legs for another rep.<br><br>8. Carry out as numerous reps as you choose, but do not go to failure or into deep tiredness.<br><br>9. Keeping your chest up and an arched back, position the kettlebells securely on the ground after your final backswing. Make sure your back doesn't round when putting the kettlebells down. This can lead to a lower back injury.<H3>Contact Us:</H3>Geoff Neupert<br>c/o Sozo, LLC<br>121 S.
