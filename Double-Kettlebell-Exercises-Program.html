He is an "advanced kettlebell user." Which is definitely amusing, considering I am an advanced kettlebell consumer, and when I observe the system as discussed - it kicks my butt. (Burn is planned to be used by anyone - no matter their "ability level.")<br><br>For that reason that got me to considering - how do you make a "basic" kettlebell program "advanced."<H3>These are some concepts that you can apply immediately.</H3>1. Use a bulkier kettlebell. This looks actually visible; however it was gone on the person requesting the refund. If you can perform it through Burn with a 48kg kettlebell, I would be pleased - really amazed. (Ok, possibly I'm still a bit taking aback ...) However well, I assume you see my point.

Adjust the rate. Do you contend through your Get Up? (I do in some cases ...) Well slow it down. This increases your time under amount, and thus, related to some power specialists, will raise your energy. Do you move at a snail's speed when you Press or Squat?

Therefore, see the number of Swings you can do with your hardest (or here's an unique concept - lightest) kettlebell in 20 minutes. Then do the very same number next time in 19 minutes.<br><br>5. Improve the complication of the workout. You can still do basic exercises and make them advanced. (You know, composing this post makes me contend that there is nothing standard at all about the Get Up ...) For instance - let's say you can do 10 minutes of Get Ups with a 24kg. That's nice work. "Standard" but nice. What if you stacked 2 12kgs in your hand and after that did your Get Ups. Could you still get the very same variety of GUs because 10 minutes (see point # 4).
